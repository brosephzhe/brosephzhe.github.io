          <h2>Who and what is a Huggy Wuggy?</h2>
      </h1>
    <img src="images/huggywuggy.jpg" alt="Blue, furry, teddy bear like toy with sharp teeth">
    <p>Huggy Wuggy is a tall, blue humanoid creature standing unnaturally tall, towering over most people, with cartoonish red lips and plastic eyes.
    Blue fur covers the majority of its body, with the exception of his yellow feet and palms, Huggy Wuggy, apparently has a face inside it's mouth, 
   I can't wait to see people crying about if it has a person inside of it or not. This entity is shown to be flexible in its movements, as it can bend
    to pass low doorways and move in the vents easily. Little is known about Huggy himself, but a VHS tape left by an anonymous personnel spoke of an
    experiment involving the testing of an entity labeled as 'Experiment 1-0-0-6'. Though yet to be revealed, this test subject is presumed to be 
   Huggy Wuggy himself. At some point, the experiment had gone haywire, the subject in question wreaking havoc and mauling workers around him.</p><p>When knocking him down off the railing of the underground area of the abandoned factory, Huggy can be seen leaving a splatter of blood on each pipe
    he crashes into, indicating that Experiment 1-0-0-6 used to be an organic living being, most likely the remnants of former employee' of Playtime. Co.)
